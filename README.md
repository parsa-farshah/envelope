## ✉️ What Is Envelope?

**Envelope** is a creative micro-interaction UI component that simulates the action of an envelope opening to reveal a letter when hovered over.  
It demonstrates the power of **CSS transitions** and **transformations** to bring static elements to life.

> A beautiful example of motion design using only HTML & CSS.

⚡ Perfect for portfolios, UI practice, or playful web elements.
